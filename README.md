## Background

One of the most important skills, especially for early stage companies, for founders, builders, product managers, QA testers - everyone basically, is to be detail-oriented in the work that they do.

This is a fun quick game, to see how detail-oriented are _you_.

We're building this over the weekend of April 13th-April 14th, come see our Linkedin posts documenting the 2-day journey:
